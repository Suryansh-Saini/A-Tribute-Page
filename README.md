It is my First basic Html Project as I am learning Frontend Web Development.<br/>
It is a Tribute Page of Mr. Ratan Tata Sir made using HTML and CSS.<br/>
I have **embedded a youtube video** in it and **inserted an image**. Both are **responsive**<br/>
I have also made a **Table. (It is responsive too.)**
